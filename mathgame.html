    <h2>VISION</h2>
    <p>We view Math as a way to build the mind<br>
	and spirit of a person. We view it as a way<br>
	to gain knowledge. It gives a person a unique<br>
	way to build their mind, like a variable in the<br> 
	form of a different letter with a different exponent.</p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#80ed99; color:white; text-align:center;">
    <h2>MISSION</h2>
    <p>We promote math as means to help a person<br>
	gain the "needs" he/she needs. Through this site,<br>
	people can challenge them selves to build themselves.<br>
	We wish for anyone to learn that math teaches them that<br>
	somethings starts as a problem that must be solved and<br>
	must be solved correctly through their ways.<br>
	After all, Math is not only a problem,<br>
	it is the building block and the training of our minds.</p>
