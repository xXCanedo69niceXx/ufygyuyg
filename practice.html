<h1>Martha Graham</h1>
  <p>“I believe that we learn by practice. Whether it means to learn to dance by practicing dancing or to learn to live by practicing living, the principles are the same. In each, it is the performance of a dedicated precise set of acts, physical or intellectual, from which comes shape of achievement, a sense of one's being, a satisfaction of spirit. One becomes, in some area, an athlete of God. Practice means to perform, over and over again in the face of all obstacles, some act of vision, of faith, of desire. Practice is a means of inviting the perfection desired.”</p>
 <p>Each practice is a step in the right direction. Stay committed and you will get to where you are destined to go.  </p>
 <p>Practice means analyzing your opponent from all angles, playing out every possibility until you are perfect, and then doing it all over again in the morning. </p>
